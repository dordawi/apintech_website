# Alpin-tech website

This is a simple website for the rope access company. The website is my first independent project. 

It has a:
- header, 
- footer, slider, 
- "about us" section, 
- offer presentation section,
- filtered photo gallery. 

#### The website is written in html, css and java script.

It has responsive styles that works on tablets and smartphones. For smaller screens there is a hamburger menu in the nav bar.
